# Youtube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

## Introduction
This project aims to collect YouTube data using the Google API, store it in MongoDB, migrate the stored data to SQL, and create a user-friendly Streamlit web application for visualization. Here's a breakdown of the technologies and steps involved:

1. **Collecting YouTube Data**: Utilizing the Google API to fetch data such as channel information and video details from YouTube.
2. **Storing Data**: Storing the collected data in MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.
3. **Migrating Data**: Transferring the data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, a relational database suitable for structured data.
4. **Creating a Web Application**: Developing a Streamlit web application to visualize the YouTube channel and video details, providing insights and a better understanding of the data.

## Skills Takeaway
- Python Scripting: Utilizing Python for scripting tasks.
- Data Collection: Gathering data from external sources, such as YouTube, using APIs.
- API Integration: Incorporating the Google API to interact with YouTube.
- Streamlit: Building interactive web applications using Streamlit, a Python library.
- Data Management: Handling data storage and migration between different databases (MongoDB and PostgreSQL).

## Libraries/Packages Used
- `googleapiclient`: Used for interacting with the YouTube API.
- `pymongo`: Python driver for MongoDB, facilitating interaction with the database.
- `psycopg2`: Python adapter for PostgreSQL, enabling communication with the SQL database.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation library used for creating DataFrames.
- `streamlit`: Library for creating web applications with Python.

## Technology Stack Used
- **Python 3.11**: Programming language used for development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system used for storing structured data.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing unstructured data.
- **Google Client Library**: Library for accessing Google APIs.
- **Streamlit**: Python library for creating interactive web applications.
- **IDE (VS Code)**: Integrated Development Environment used for coding.

Overall, this project involves a combination of data collection, storage, migration, and visualization using Python and     related libraries.
